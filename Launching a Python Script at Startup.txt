-Launching a Python Script at Startup-----------------------------------------------------

To begin determine where you want to store the program.
I store the program in the debian home folder. 

Start by navigating to the home directory:

cd ~
pwd


Next open the the path to the location where the program will be stored:

cd /home/debian


Name your program and launch a blank python project:

nano myProgramName.py

Now write your program. When you are finished hit ctrl + x, and then Y,
and then enter to navigate back to the terminal.

Once in the terminal if you want to test your program you can type:

sudo python myProgramName.py




Setting up Run at Boot

We are using Cron to run our python script at startup, so we will type:

sudo crontab -e

and at the very bottom of the page (after all the text) we will add:

@reboot python /home/debian/myProgramName.py &

(Don't forget the '&'!! It's very important and the it won't work if we don't have it!)
Save the file by hitting ctrl + x, and then Y, and then enter to navigate back to the terminal.


Now your program should be ready to run at startup!
